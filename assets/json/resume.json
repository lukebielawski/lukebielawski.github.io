One particular class of them arises out of any Lie algebra, called a linear Poisson structure. In this project, we calculated the Poisson cohomlogy of different Linear Poisson structures (with power series solutions), which gave insight to the geometry of these structures. I also created Python and Sage code to be able to automatically preform these calculations.","highlights":["Calculated Cohomology groups for various linear Poisson structures via power series","Wrote Python code to automatically calculate Cohomology classes with finite degree power series","Exhibited findings at Undergraduate Research Symposium and IML Poster Session"],"startDate":"01-2024","endDate":"05-2024","url":"https://lukebielawski.github.io/projects/1_project/"}],"work":[{"name":"Varisty Tutors","position":"Remote Tutor for ACT, SAT, Competition Math","url":"https://www.varsitytutors.com/","startDate":"06-2023","endDate":"08-2023","summary":"","highlights":["Provided individual instruction to 6 students on a weekly basis over a two-month span","Measured student progress through regular testing, adapting instruction to match individual needs","Taught content as well as test-taking techniques to best prepare students for their academic goals"]},{"name":"Code Ninjas","position":"Code Sensei","url":"https://www.codeninjas.com/","startDate":"06-2022","endDate":"11-2022","summary":"","highlights":["Instructed groups of 25 students aged 8-14 on introductory JavaScript, Scratch, and Roblox","Maintained classroom equipment, offered one-on-one assistance, and operated front desk","Ran a week-long summer day camp program for students ages 3-8 introducing computer science concepts"]}],"languages":[{"language":"English","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"Italian","fluency":"Conversational","icon":""}],"skills":[{"name":"Computer Science","level":"Undergraduate","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Python","C++","MATLAB","Mathematica","Microsoft Excel"]}],"interests":[{"name":"Pure","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Poisson Geometry","Mathematical Physics","Stochastic Differential Equations","Partial Differential Equations"]},{"name":"Applied","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Quantiative Finance","Numerical Methods","Probability Theory"]}]}
