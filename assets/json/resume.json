One particular class of them arises out of any Lie algebra, called a linear Poisson structure. In this project, we calculated the Poisson cohomlogy of different Linear Poisson structures (with power series solutions), which gave insight to the geometry of these structures. I also created Python and Sage code to be able to automatically preform these calculations.","highlights":["Calculated Cohomology groups for various linear Poisson structures via power series","Wrote Python code to automatically calculate Cohomology classes with finite degree power series","Exhibited findings at Undergraduate Research Symposium and IML Poster Session"],"startDate":"01-2024","endDate":"05-2024","url":"https://lukebielawski.github.io/projects/1_project/"}],"work":[{"name":"Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton University","position":"Professor of Theoretical Physics","url":"https://example.com","startDate":"1933-01-01","endDate":"1955-01-01","summary":"Teaching at Palmer Physical Laboratory (now 302 Frist Campus Center).
