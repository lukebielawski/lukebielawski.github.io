I am a (rising third year) math and physics student at the University of Illinois. I am interested in probability theory, differential geometry, and theoretical physics. I am currently participating in an REU at the University of Maryland TREND program under Jeffrey Kuan and Konstantina Trivisa studying flocking models (Quorum Sensing and Cucker-Smale) by analyzing PDEs.
