I am a (rising) third year math and physics student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I am generally interested in probability theory and diffential geometry. Recently, I have been interested in stochastic differential equations and Poisson geometry.

I am currently (Summer 2025) participating in the TREND REU program at the University of Maryland under Jeffrey Kuan and Konstantina Trivisa. I am studying collective emergence and flocking models (Quorum Sensing and Cucker-Smale) by analyzing PDEs.

I am also a fan of finance, music / flute, and reading.
